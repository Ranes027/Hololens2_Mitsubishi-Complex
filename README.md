# üëì AR-instruction for the Mitsubishi MELFA Robotic Complex using Microsoft Hololens2 headset (virtual complex)

This app deals with the augmented reality technologies and their implementation possibilities to work with Mitsubishi MELFA robotic complex used in the educational process to get acquainted with the possibilities of industrial automation. The main stages of AR instruction development including 3D modeling of the scene, creating interface and logic of interaction with objects as well as forming an application for further deployment on the used Microsoft HoloLens 2 augmented reality headset are presented. The work was done with the help of Blender software for creating 3D computer graphics, Unity cross-platform application development environment and Visual Studio software.

## ü§ñ What can this help with?

* Augmented reality technologies make it possible to improve the quality of acquired knowledge and practical skills: more effective than "two-dimensional" instructions (documentation, operating instructions) often having a large volume of documents "on paper".

* AR-instructions can be introduced into the learning process: a student can independently perform laboratory work on an individual record, without the presence of a teacher.

* The development allows the student to study the basic capabilities of a robotic stand and learn how to perform basic operations on a virtual model, then work out the acquired knowledge and skills on a real complex.
